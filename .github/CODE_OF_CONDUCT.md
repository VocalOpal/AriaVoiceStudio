# Code of Conduct

This is a voice training tool built by and for the trans community. Everyone's welcome to use it, fork it, learn from it.

Just be decent to each other. That means:

- No harassment, bigotry, or hateful language
- Respect people's identities and experiences
- Keep feedback constructive
- Assume good intent

This is a one-person project so I don't have a moderation team. If someone's being awful in the issues or discussions, I'll deal with it when I see it. You can also flag it by opening an issue or reaching out on GitHub.

Don't be a jerk. That's basically it.
